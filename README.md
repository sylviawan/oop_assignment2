Assignment 2 for Object Oriented Programming with Bryan Duggan.

CATCH!

“It’s raining STARS on this pink sky day! CATCH as many stars as you can, but be careful — you don’t want any red meteors comin’ your way! 

Good luck!”

You are first welcomed by the home screen. This screen displays the title and also the mini character I created. To begin the game, you press the SPACE bar.

You navigate the character with the left and right arrows on the keyboard. The aim is to try and catch as many raining stars as you can while avoiding the meteors. When you move off one side of the screen, you’ll return back on the other side. 

Once you’ve wasted all go your lives, you can view your score at the end. You can then press ‘z’ to return back to the home screen.
